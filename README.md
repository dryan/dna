# dryan's DNA


## My Genome

This is my DNA from [23andMe](http://refer.23andme.com/a/clk/16KybV "23 and Me").

The data is located in [genome.txt](https://github.com/dryan/dna/blob/master/genome.txt). The fields are TAB-separated. Each line corresponds to a single SNP.  For each SNP, we provide its identifier (an rsid or an internal id), its location on the reference human genome, and the genotype call oriented with respect to the plus strand on the human reference sequence.

This uses reference [human assembly build 37 (also known as Annotation Release 104)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/map_search.cgi?taxid=9606).

## Viewing

The genome file is giant. The easiest way to view it is to [download this repository](https://github.com/dryan/dna/archive/master.zip) and open it in your favorite text editor.


#### Original Idea

I first discovered 23andme from [Manik Rathee](https://github.com/manikrathee) and liberally borrowed most of this README from him.
